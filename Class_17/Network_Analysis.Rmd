```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
library(RCy3)
library(igraph)
library(RColorBrewer)
```

Can we talk to Cytoscape from R

```{r}
cytoscapePing()
```
We can test things further by making a small network (here in igraph format as used by the R igraph package) and sending it to Cytoscape:

```{r}
g <- makeSimpleIgraph()
createNetworkFromIgraph(g,"myGraph")

```

We can include this Cytoscape rendered network image in our report with the following code:

```{r}
fig <- exportImage(filename="demo", type="png", height=350)
knitr::include_graphics("./demo.png")

```


Switch Styles
Cytoscape provides a number of canned visual styles. The code below explores some of these styles. For example check out the marquee style!

```{r}
setVisualStyle("Marquee")

```


```{r}
fig <- exportImage(filename="demo_marquee", type="png", height=350)

knitr::include_graphics("./demo_marquee.png")

```
