```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
library(DESeq2)

```


##Load in the Data

```{r}
metaFile <- "GSE37704_metadata.csv"
countFile <- "GSE37704_featurecounts.csv"

```

# Import metadata and take a peak
```{r}

colData = read.csv(metaFile, row.names=1)
head(colData)
```

# Import countdata
```{r}
rawcountData = read.csv(countFile, row.names=1)
head(rawcountData)
```


## Hmm... remember that we need the countData and colData files to match up so we will need to remove that odd first column in countData namely contData$length.

```{r}
countData <- as.matrix(rawcountData[,-1])
#could also run the above as countData <- as.matrix(rawcountData[,2:7])
head(countData)

```

There are genes with 0 counts in every condition, and so we're going to try to remove these columns.

Going to sum the rows and figure out which ones are equal to 0, taking the ones that are not 0 (!=)

```{r}
countData <- countData[rowSums(countData) != 0, ]
nrow(countData)
```
```{r}
dim(countData)
```

#Let's run DESeq on this biizzzzzzz




```{r}
dds = DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData=countData,
                             colData=colData,
                             design=~condition)

dds = DESeq(dds)
dds
```

Next, get results for the HoxA1 knockdown versus control siRNA (remember that these were labeled as "hoxa1_kd" and "control_sirna" in our original colData metaFile input to DESeq, you can check this above and by running resultsNames(dds) command).

```{r}
res = results(dds)
res
```

#Make volcano plot of the LOG2FC and -log(pvalue)

```{r}
plot(res$log2FoldChange, -log(res$padj), ylab="-Log(P-adj)", xlab="Log2(FoldChange)")
abline(v=c(-2,2), col="darkgray", lty=2)
abline(h=-log(0.05), col="darkgray", lty=2)

```

#get some sweet colorsssss

```{r}
mycols <- rep("gray", nrow(res))
mycols[ abs(res$log2FoldChange) > 2 ]  <- "red" 

inds <- (res$padj < 0.01 & (abs(res$log2FoldChange) > 2 )
mycols[ inds ] <- "blue"

plot( res$log2FoldChange,  -log(res$padj), 
 col=mycols, ylab="-Log(P-value)", xlab="Log2(FoldChange)" )

abline(v=c(-2,2), col="gray", lty=2)
abline(h=-log(0.1), col="gray", lty=2)



```

# Load annotation bioconductor packages


```{r}
library("AnnotationDbi")
library("org.Hs.eg.db")

columns(org.Hs.eg.db)

```
 Let's map our ENSEMBLE gene ids to the more conventional gene SYMBOL, and a few others too
 
```{r}

res$symbol = mapIds(org.Hs.eg.db,
                    keys=rownames(res), 
                    keytype="ENSEMBL",
                    column="SYMBOL",
                    multiVals="first")

res$entrez = mapIds(org.Hs.eg.db,
                    keys=rownames(res),
                    keytype="ENSEMBL",
                    column="ENTREZID",
                    multiVals="first")

res$name =   mapIds(org.Hs.eg.db,
                    keys=row.names(res),
                    keytype="ENSEMBL",
                    column="GENENAME",
                    multiVals="first")

head(res,10)
write.csv(x = res, file = "myresults.csv")


```
 
# Now let's do some pathway analysis

```{r}
library(pathview)
library(gage)
library(gageData)

data(kegg.sets.hs)
data(sigmet.idx.hs)

```

```{r}
# Focus on signaling and metabolic pathways only
kegg.sets.hs = kegg.sets.hs[sigmet.idx.hs]

# Examine the first 3 pathways
head(kegg.sets.hs, 3)

```


Our input will be a vector of fold change valued with ENTREZ gene ids as names

```{r}
foldchanges = res$log2FoldChange
names(foldchanges) = res$entrez
head(foldchanges)
```

```{r}
# Get the results
keggres = gage(foldchanges, gsets=kegg.sets.hs)
attributes(keggres)

```

```{r}
# Look at the first few down (less) pathways
head(keggres$less)

```

Now, let's try out the pathview() function from the pathview package to make a pathway plot with our RNA-Seq expression results shown in color.
To begin with lets manually supply a pathway.id (namely the first part of the "hsa04110 Cell cycle") that we could see from the print out above.

```{r}
pathview(gene.data=foldchanges, pathway.id="hsa04110")

```
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("hsa04110.pathview.png")
```

```{r}
## Focus on top 5 upregulated pathways here for demo purposes only
keggrespathways <- rownames(keggres$greater)[1:5]

# Extract the 8 character long IDs part of each string
keggresids = substr(keggrespathways, start=1, stop=8)
keggresids

```

Finally, lets pass these IDs in keggresids to the pathview() function to draw plots for all the top 5 pathways.

```{r}
pathview(gene.data=foldchanges, pathway.id=keggresids, species="hsa")

```


Now time for some GO analysis biatttccchhh

```{r}
data(go.sets.hs)
data(go.subs.hs)

# Focus on Biological Process subset of GO
gobpsets = go.sets.hs[go.subs.hs$BP]

gobpres = gage(foldchanges, gsets=gobpsets, same.dir=TRUE)

lapply(gobpres, head)

```
